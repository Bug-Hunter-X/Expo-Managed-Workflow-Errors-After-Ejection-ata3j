# Expo Managed Workflow Errors After Ejection

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur when using Expo's managed workflow after ejecting a project.  Ejecting significantly alters the project structure and build process, potentially breaking functionality relying on Expo APIs and features. This example focuses on [mention a specific API or feature here, e.g., using a specific Expo module after ejection].

## Problem Description

After ejecting the project, using [mention the specific API or feature] leads to [describe the specific error or unexpected behavior]. This is because [explain the underlying reason, e.g., Expo's internal modules are no longer available or the build system has changed].

## Solution

The solution involves [explain the steps to resolve the issue. This might involve using a different approach, configuring the build process, or replacing Expo's functionality with a native alternative]. See `bugSolution.js` for a working implementation.
