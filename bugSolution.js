The solution depends on the exact API or feature causing the issue.  Here's a general strategy:

1. **Identify the affected Expo API:** Pinpoint the exact Expo API or module that's causing problems after ejection.
2. **Check Expo Documentation:** Consult the Expo documentation to see if there are any known issues or recommendations for using the API in an ejected project.
3. **Find an Alternative:**  If the API is incompatible with the ejected workflow, seek an alternative solution that doesn't rely on it. This might involve using native modules or libraries.
4. **Manual Configuration:** You might need to manually configure the build process (e.g., setting up environment variables or modifying build scripts) to ensure the necessary dependencies and configurations are correctly applied. 

Example (Illustrative - adapt this to your specific error):
```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import * as React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'; // Standard React Native components instead of Expo's

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>This component now works correctly in the ejected project.</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
