This bug occurs when using the Expo managed workflow with a project that has been ejected.  After ejecting, the project structure and build process change, and some Expo APIs or features might not function correctly. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or build failures. The specific error message might vary depending on the API or feature involved and the way it was used in the ejected project.
